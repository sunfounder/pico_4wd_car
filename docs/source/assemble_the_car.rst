Assemble the Car
======================

.. note::
    When you assemble the ultrasonic module, you need to keep the servo at 0°, which is done in :ref:`Test the Servo`.
    
    If you accidentally turn the servo shaft, please take down the rocker arm, run ``test.py`` code (uncomment ``test_servo()``) again, and then continue to assemble.
