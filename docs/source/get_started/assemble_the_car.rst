5. Assemble the Car
======================

.. note::
    When you assemble the ultrasonic module, you need to keep the servo at 0Â°, which is done in :ref:`test_servo`.
    
    If you accidentally turn the servo shaft, please take down the rocker arm, run ``test_servo.py`` code again, and then continue to assemble.
