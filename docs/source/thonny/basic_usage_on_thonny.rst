1. Basic Usage on Thonny
============================

In this section, you will learn how to download and install Thonny, install MicroPython firmware, upload libraries, run scripts and make scripts run offline.

If you are familiar with using Thonny, you can skip this chapter.

For :ref:`install_micropython_on_pico` and :ref:`upload_libraries_py` with optional flags after them, it is because the Pico 4WD Car is shipped with MicroPython firmware and the corresponding libraries already installed.
So these two steps can be left out in general, but of course you can do it if you want.
