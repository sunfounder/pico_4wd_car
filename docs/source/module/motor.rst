1. Motor
=============

In this chapter, you will learn how motors work and how the 4 motors work together to make the car move.

From driving the 4 motors directly with high and low levels, to using PWM to set the speed, to encapsulating the motor related code into modules (libraries). 

With this step-by-step method, you can learn how to move the car thoroughly.
