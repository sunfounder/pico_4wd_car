3. Funny Projects
==========================

In this project, you will learn how to combine different modules to make the Pico 4WD car do interesting projects!

    .. note::
        You need to check if your Raspberry Pi Pico contains these libraries first. If not, you can refer to the tutorial :ref:`upload_libraries_py` to upload them.
    .. note::

        In order to allow the car to move on the ground without the USB cable connected, you need to save this script as ``main.py`` to Raspberry Pi Pico, see :ref:`run_script_offline` for a tutorial.
