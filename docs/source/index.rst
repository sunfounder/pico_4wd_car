The Pico-4wd is a Raspberry Pi Pico based, cool, robot car kit that everyone can have.

Equipped with greyscale sensor module and ultrasonic module, it can perform line tracking, cliff detection, follow and obstacle avoidance functions. The RGB boards assembled at the bottom and rear of the car make it the coolest spirit in the dark.

We have provided sample code based on MicroPython so you can get started quickly.

In addition, you can also use an app - SunFounder Controller - to DIY your own control methods! Let's Play!
