3. Programming Mode
=======================
The programming mode chapter is divided into 3 main parts in total, and you are advised to read them in order.

* :ref:`usage_thonny`: This contains installation of the Thonny IDE, installation of MicroPython firmware and libraries for Pico, online and offline running of scripts.
* :ref:`learn_modules`: This is a new section added in v2.0, allowing you to learn how each module works, then learn how to program them step by step, and finally encapsulate them individually into libraries.
* :ref:`funny_projects`: This is the part that combines different modules to make Pico 4WD achieve different interesting functions.
