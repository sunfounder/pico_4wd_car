Introduction to Pico RDP
===================================

The Pico Robotics Development Platform (RDP) is a Wi-Fi extension module for the Raspberry Pi Pico designed by SunFounder.

It integrates industry-leading Wi-Fi solutions, rich peripheral interfaces, and supports multiple compilers for development.

It also has IO expansion interface circuitry, LED power indicator circuitry, voltage measurement circuitry, and an on-board 4-channel DC motor driver circuit.

When you use Pico RDP for development and debugging, you can connect peripherals as needed, and the rich external interfaces can make your projects more interesting.
